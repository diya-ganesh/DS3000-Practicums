## Introduction

The DS3000 course emphasizes hands-on experience in data science, covering topics such as data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and statistical modeling. This repository showcases a series of practicum projects that apply these concepts to real-world datasets, demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Practicum Projects

1. **Air Traffic Patterns Analysis**:
   - **Description**: Analyzes air traffic data to understand flight behaviors, delays, and airline performance across California, Nevada, and Arizona.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Flight path visualization
     - Traffic density analysis
     - Temporal trend analysis
   - **Files**:
     - `analyze_traffic.py`
     - `air_traffic_data.csv`

2. **Predictive Modeling for Diabetes Risk**:
   - **Description**: Develops a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes using health and demographic indicators.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
     - Model development and evaluation
     - Exploratory data analysis
   - **Files**:
     - `diabetes_modeling.ipynb`
     - `diabetes_health_indicators.csv`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diya-ganesh/DS3000-Practicums.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd DS3000-Practicums
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Select a practicum project**:
   - Navigate to the desired project directory (e.g., `Air-Traffic-Patterns`).
2. **Prepare the data**:
   - Ensure that the necessary datasets are available in the appropriate directory.
3. **Run the analysis scripts**:
   - Execute the main script or notebook as specified in the project's README file.
4. **View the results**:
   - Analyze the output, which may include visualizations, statistical summaries, or model evaluations.
